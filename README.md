React frontend mini-project I made for fullstackopen.com course thanks to Open-University and the University of Helsinki.

In this project I learned all the basic usage of React as design goes while also integrating my own API made in Node.js and Express, with persistence with MongoDB
It's a simple ui phonebook where you can directly add your phone and name and It will be saved on my mongo atlas database.

As react goes, with this project I learned the basics of React such as:
- Components 
- State with useState hook 
- props.
- JSX
- Function components
- useEffect hook
- Conditional rendering
- List while using higher order functions from ES5
- Forms

As for communication with my backend I learned:

- Axios library usage
- Making requests within a service with axios
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH requests
- Promises with get.then and async/await.
